    <img src="../im/coquito.jpg" alt="two coquito drinks">

    <p class="descrizione">Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.<br> 
    It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and in this version, egg yolks.<br>
    It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself!<br>
    Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired.<br>
    Feliz Navidad!</p>

    <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredienti">
        <li><strong>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk:</strong>This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2 large egg yolks, beaten:</strong>Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut:</strong>Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk:</strong>Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>½ cup white rum:</strong>The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li><strong>½ cup water:</strong>Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract:</strong>A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon:</strong>Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
        <li><strong>¼ teaspoon ground cloves:</strong>Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
