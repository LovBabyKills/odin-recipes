    <img src="../im/carbonara.jpg" alt="Spaghetti alla Carbonara">

    <p class="descrizione">Carbonara is a Roman pasta dish made with eggs, pecorino cheese and guanciale.<br>
        Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.<br> 
        The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook <br>
        the eggs,but not so hot that they curdle.

    <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>

    <ol class="passaggi">
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.

        </li>
        <li>Chop the guanciale, having first removed any rind.
    </li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.

    </li>
        <li>When the water starts boiling add salt and add the pasta in it.<br>
        Let the pasta cook for 1 or 2 min less then what indicated.
    </li>
        <li>Put the chopped guanciale on a frying pan, don't add anything to it.
            The guanciale will release its own fat in the pan.<br>
            Let the guanciale cook until it is crisp, and take half of it out of the pan.<br>
            Leave the rest in the pan setting the heat on low.
    </li>
        <li>When the pasta is ready, turn off the heat from the frying pan with the gunaciale in it.<br>
        Then with a pasta fork or tongs put the pasta in the frying pan<br>
        with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well <br>
        (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.
    </li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.<br>
        If needed add a little bit of pasta cooking water to keep it saucy.<br>
        You don't want it wet, just moist.
    </li>
        <li>Stir in the guanciale, then top with the remaining cheese and more black pepper.
    </li>
    </ol>
